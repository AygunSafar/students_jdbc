This repository contains a Java application for managing student records using JDBC (Java Database Connectivity). It includes a StudentService class with methods 
for creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting student information from a PostgreSQL database database. The code follows basic JDBC practices and includes a set of SQL  queries stored in an enum for easy access. Note that this implementation does not use connection pooling.
